# DatDude Weather Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- **Launch MVP in 6 weeks** with 7 core features: interactive map, location dashboard, search, precipitation alerts, severe weather alerts, activity recommendations, and PWA foundation
- **Acquire 1,000 monthly active users** (3+ sessions/week) within first 3 months through organic growth
- **Deliver < 10-minute precipitation timing accuracy** using OpenWeatherMap's hyperlocal data
- **Enable 500+ remote workers** to save 15+ minutes daily through unified weather dashboard
- **Serve 100+ solar panel owners** with generation estimates achieving 85% accuracy
- **Achieve 20% weekly active user retention** by month 6 (vs 12% industry average)
- **Generate $500+ MRR by month 4** with 50 premium subscribers at $9.99/month
- **Maintain < $0.20 per user monthly infrastructure costs** through aggressive caching

### Background Context

DatDude Weather emerges from a clear market gap: technical professionals currently waste 15-20 minutes daily aggregating weather data from 3-5 different sources, with no single platform offering the precision, visualization, and automation capabilities they need. Our solution is a Progressive Web Application built with Angular 19 (frontend) and NestJS (backend), leveraging OpenWeatherMap's API and Google Maps to deliver a uniquely technical-user-focused experience.

The MVP focuses on three killer differentiators: (1) an interactive weather map where users can click anywhere for instant conditions, (2) precision precipitation alerts that notify "rain in X minutes", and (3) smart activity recommendations that score conditions for running, cycling, gardening, and outdoor work. With 4.7 million remote tech workers managing home infrastructure and 6.2 million US households with rooftop solar panels, we're targeting an underserved market ready for a weather platform that treats atmospheric data as a programmable resource, not just a display widget.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The DatDude Weather interface leverages Material Design 3 (Material You) principles to create an adaptive, personalized experience that balances information density with visual clarity. The design embraces Material 3's dynamic color system, allowing the interface to adapt to user preferences while maintaining the data-rich displays technical users expect. Dark mode by default with Material 3's surface tint and elevation system creates depth without overwhelming the information hierarchy. The interface respects power users through keyboard shortcuts, voice commands, and efficient workflows while maintaining Material Design's accessibility and usability standards.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Map-First Navigation:** The interactive weather map serves as the primary interface, allowing users to explore weather patterns visually before diving into detailed data
- **Voice-Driven Search:** Web Speech API integration enables hands-free location search and weather queries with visual feedback following Material 3 motion principles
- **Card-Based Information Architecture:** Material 3 cards with elevated surfaces organize weather data in flippable containers that reveal progressive detail levels
- **Gesture-Driven Mobile Experience:** Material 3 gesture navigation - swipe to switch locations, pull-to-refresh with Material motion, long-press for contextual actions
- **Keyboard-Centric Desktop Usage:** Tab navigation, arrow keys for map panning, number keys for quick location switching
- **Smart Defaults Over Configuration:** Intelligent assumptions about user preferences with minimal setup required

### Core Screens and Views

- **Map View** - Full-screen interactive map with Material 3 FAB for actions and floating cards using elevated surfaces
- **Dashboard View** - Material 3 grid layout with responsive columns, cards using filled/outlined variants based on importance
- **Location Detail View** - Expanded Material 3 card with tabs for hourly forecast, activity recommendations, and alerts
- **Search/Add Location View** - Material 3 search bar with voice input button, autocomplete chips, and recent searches in list items
- **Settings View** - Material 3 preference screens with switches, sliders, and segmented buttons for options
- **Solar Calculator View** - Material 3 form fields with outlined text inputs and filled buttons for calculation
- **Activity Timeline View** - Material 3 data tables with color-coded cells indicating condition quality

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

The application will meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards leveraging Material Design 3's built-in accessibility features including proper color contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum), keyboard navigation for all interactive elements, screen reader announcements for weather updates, and alternative text for all weather icons. Voice input will include visual feedback for users who are deaf or hard of hearing.

### Branding

Material Design 3 theming with custom color schemes derived from weather conditions (dynamic color). Primary color adapts based on current weather (blue for clear, gray for cloudy, etc.) while maintaining Material 3's tonal relationships. Weather icons follow Material Symbols guidelines with filled, outlined, and rounded variants. Typography uses Material 3's type scale with Roboto for UI and Roboto Mono for data display.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Progressive Web App following Material Design 3 responsive layouts with breakpoints at 600dp (compact), 840dp (medium), and 1240dp+ (expanded). Adaptive navigation using Material 3's navigation rail (tablet) and navigation drawer (mobile) patterns. Touch targets meet Material Design's 48dp minimum. Voice search available on all platforms with Web Speech API support.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

The project will use an Nx workspace monorepo structure to manage both the Angular frontend and NestJS backend in a single repository. This enables code sharing through TypeScript interfaces, consistent tooling, unified CI/CD pipelines, and synchronized versioning between frontend and backend components.

### Service Architecture

**Hybrid Client-Server Architecture:** The application follows a progressive enhancement model with a lightweight NestJS backend serving as an API gateway and caching layer, while the Angular PWA handles most logic client-side. The NestJS server proxies OpenWeatherMap and NWS APIs to protect API keys, implements response caching to reduce API costs, handles push notification subscriptions, and provides rate limiting. The Angular frontend manages all UI state, implements service workers for offline functionality, and handles client-side data persistence via IndexedDB.

### Testing Requirements

**Full Testing Pyramid:** Unit tests achieving 80% coverage for business logic using Jest for both Angular and NestJS. Integration tests for all API endpoints and critical user workflows. E2E tests using Cypress for the complete user journey from search to alerts. Performance testing to validate sub-3-second load times. Accessibility testing to ensure WCAG AA compliance. Manual testing convenience methods including seed data generation and API mocking for offline development.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Framework Versions:** Angular 19 (latest stable) with standalone components, NestJS 10+ with latest decorators and middleware
- **State Management:** RxJS Observables and BehaviorSubjects for all reactive state management (proven, stable, excellent TypeScript support), avoiding experimental signals
- **API Integration:** OpenWeatherMap One Call API 3.0 for weather data, Google Maps JavaScript API v3 for mapping, National Weather Service API for US alerts
- **Build Tools:** Nx for monorepo orchestration, Webpack 5 for bundling, Jest for testing
- **Deployment:** Simple Node.js deployment for both services, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, Vercel for Angular static hosting, Railway/Render for NestJS API
- **Monitoring:** NestJS built-in logging, Angular ErrorHandler for client errors, Google Analytics 4 for usage metrics
- **Security:** JWT tokens for future authentication, rate limiting per IP address, CSP headers, HTTPS-only
- **Performance:** Lazy loading for Angular routes, virtual scrolling for lists, image optimization with WebP, aggressive HTTP caching
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with TypeORM for future user accounts (Phase 2), IndexedDB for client-side storage
- **Real-time Updates:** Server-Sent Events (SSE) for weather updates if needed, Web Push API for notifications
