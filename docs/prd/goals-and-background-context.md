- **Maintain < $0.20 per user monthly infrastructure costs** through aggressive caching

## Background Context

DatDude Weather emerges from a clear market gap: technical professionals currently waste 15-20 minutes daily aggregating weather data from 3-5 different sources, with no single platform offering the precision, visualization, and automation capabilities they need. Our solution is a Progressive Web Application built with Angular 19 (frontend) and NestJS (backend), leveraging OpenWeatherMap's API and Google Maps to deliver a uniquely technical-user-focused experience.

The MVP focuses on three killer differentiators: (1) an interactive weather map where users can click anywhere for instant conditions, (2) precision precipitation alerts that notify "rain in X minutes", and (3) smart activity recommendations that score conditions for running, cycling, gardening, and outdoor work. With 4.7 million remote tech workers managing home infrastructure and 6.2 million US households with rooftop solar panels, we're targeting an underserved market ready for a weather platform that treats atmospheric data as a programmable resource, not just a display widget.
