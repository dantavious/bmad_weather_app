# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The DatDude Weather interface leverages Material Design 3 (Material You) principles to create an adaptive, personalized experience that balances information density with visual clarity. The design embraces Material 3's dynamic color system, allowing the interface to adapt to user preferences while maintaining the data-rich displays technical users expect. Dark mode by default with Material 3's surface tint and elevation system creates depth without overwhelming the information hierarchy. The interface respects power users through keyboard shortcuts, voice commands, and efficient workflows while maintaining Material Design's accessibility and usability standards.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Map-First Navigation:** The interactive weather map serves as the primary interface, allowing users to explore weather patterns visually before diving into detailed data
- **Voice-Driven Search:** Web Speech API integration enables hands-free location search and weather queries with visual feedback following Material 3 motion principles
- **Card-Based Information Architecture:** Material 3 cards with elevated surfaces organize weather data in flippable containers that reveal progressive detail levels
- **Gesture-Driven Mobile Experience:** Material 3 gesture navigation - swipe to switch locations, pull-to-refresh with Material motion, long-press for contextual actions
- **Keyboard-Centric Desktop Usage:** Tab navigation, arrow keys for map panning, number keys for quick location switching
- **Smart Defaults Over Configuration:** Intelligent assumptions about user preferences with minimal setup required

## Core Screens and Views

- **Map View** - Full-screen interactive map with Material 3 FAB for actions and floating cards using elevated surfaces
- **Dashboard View** - Material 3 grid layout with responsive columns, cards using filled/outlined variants based on importance
- **Location Detail View** - Expanded Material 3 card with tabs for hourly forecast, activity recommendations, and alerts
- **Search/Add Location View** - Material 3 search bar with voice input button, autocomplete chips, and recent searches in list items
- **Settings View** - Material 3 preference screens with switches, sliders, and segmented buttons for options
- **Solar Calculator View** - Material 3 form fields with outlined text inputs and filled buttons for calculation
- **Activity Timeline View** - Material 3 data tables with color-coded cells indicating condition quality

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The application will meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards leveraging Material Design 3's built-in accessibility features including proper color contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum), keyboard navigation for all interactive elements, screen reader announcements for weather updates, and alternative text for all weather icons. Voice input will include visual feedback for users who are deaf or hard of hearing.

## Branding

Material Design 3 theming with custom color schemes derived from weather conditions (dynamic color). Primary color adapts based on current weather (blue for clear, gray for cloudy, etc.) while maintaining Material 3's tonal relationships. Weather icons follow Material Symbols guidelines with filled, outlined, and rounded variants. Typography uses Material 3's type scale with Roboto for UI and Roboto Mono for data display.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Progressive Web App following Material Design 3 responsive layouts with breakpoints at 600dp (compact), 840dp (medium), and 1240dp+ (expanded). Adaptive navigation using Material 3's navigation rail (tablet) and navigation drawer (mobile) patterns. Touch targets meet Material Design's 48dp minimum. Voice search available on all platforms with Web Speech API support.
