# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://maps.googleapis.com`
- XSS Prevention: Angular's built-in sanitization
- Secure Storage: Sensitive data only in memory

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: NestJS ValidationPipe with class-validator DTOs
- Rate Limiting: 60 requests/minute per IP via custom guard
- CORS Policy: `origin: ['http://localhost:4200'], credentials: true`

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: < 200KB initial (with lazy loading)
- Loading Strategy: Lazy load map and PWA features
- Caching Strategy: Service Worker with cache-first for assets

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: < 100ms for cached, < 500ms for fresh data
- Database Optimization: In-memory cache, file-based persistence
- Caching Strategy: 10-minute TTL for weather, 1-hour for forecasts
