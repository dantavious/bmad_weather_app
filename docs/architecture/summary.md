# Summary

This architecture document provides a comprehensive blueprint for building DatDude Weather as a local-first MVP with clear migration paths to production. Key architectural decisions include:

1. **Simplified Infrastructure:** npm workspaces instead of Nx for rapid development
2. **Local-First Approach:** Everything runs locally for the 6-week MVP timeline
3. **Modern Stack:** Angular 20 + NestJS 11 with latest features
4. **Smart Caching:** Achieve 70% API call reduction through layered caching
5. **PWA Excellence:** Full offline support with graceful degradation
6. **Type Safety:** Shared TypeScript models ensure consistency

The architecture is designed to be pragmatic, focused on delivering a working MVP quickly while maintaining clean code and clear upgrade paths for future enhancements.
