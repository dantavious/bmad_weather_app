# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for DatDude Weather, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on review of the PRD and brief, this is a **greenfield project** using **npm workspaces** for monorepo management (simplified from the originally specified Nx workspace for faster MVP development). The workspace will manage both the Angular 20 frontend and NestJS backend in a single repository with shared TypeScript interfaces.
