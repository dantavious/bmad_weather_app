# DatDude Weather UI/UX Specification

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for DatDude Weather's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

#### Target User Personas

- **Tech-Savvy Outdoor Athlete:** Software engineers and IT professionals who run, cycle, or hike daily - need precision timing for optimal conditions, care about metrics like "feels like" temperature, humidity impact on performance, and wind resistance for cycling
- **Technical Garden Enthusiast:** Developers and data analysts with home gardens who track soil moisture windows, frost warnings, UV index for plant stress, and precipitation amounts for irrigation planning
- **Remote Worker Adventurer:** Technical professionals optimizing WFH schedules around outdoor windows - checking weather during standup calls, planning lunch rides, and timing evening runs between meetings

#### Usability Goals

- New users can add location and see activity recommendations within 30 seconds
- Power users can check all locations + activity scores in under 10 seconds
- Precipitation alerts achieve 90% accuracy for 10-minute warnings
- One-handed operation for all core features (checking during activities)
- Offline mode loads cached data instantly (< 500ms)
- Voice commands work with wind noise/breathing (outdoor scenario)

#### Design Principles

1. **Glanceable Insights** - Critical info readable in 2 seconds while moving
2. **Predictive Intelligence** - Proactively surface "windows of opportunity" for activities
3. **Data Density with Hierarchy** - Technical details available but never obstruct primary insights
4. **Context-Aware Displays** - Morning shows sunrise/conditions, evening shows next-day forecast
5. **Performance as Feature** - Sub-2-second loads even on trail with poor cell signal
6. **Customizable Depths** - Let users choose their data complexity level per activity

```

### Navigation Structure

**Primary Navigation:** Bottom navigation bar (mobile) / Side rail (tablet+) with 4 main sections:
- Map (default view) - Interactive weather exploration with `@slideIn` animation for overlays
- Dashboard - Multi-location cards with `@flipCard` animation for forecast reveals
- Activities - Personalized recommendations with `@stagger` animation for list items
- Settings - Configuration with `@expand` animations for sections

**Secondary Navigation:** Contextual FABs with `@fabScale` animation and action sheets using `@slideUp` animation. All navigational transitions use Angular's `RouterOutlet` animations with `@routeSlide` for smooth view changes.

**Animation Principles (using Angular Animations API):**
- **State Changes:** Use `trigger()` and `state()` for weather condition transitions
- **Route Transitions:** Implement `query()` and `group()` for coordinated page animations
- **List Animations:** Apply `stagger()` for location cards and activity recommendations
- **Micro-interactions:** Leverage `keyframes()` for weather icon animations and loading states
- **Performance:** Use `animateChild()` strategically and CSS transform properties for 60fps

**Breadcrumb Strategy:** Minimal breadcrumbs with `@fadeIn` animation - only for deep-dive data views. Primary navigation always visible with `@slideReveal` for context switching.

## User Flows

### Flow 1: Quick Activity Check

**User Goal:** Check if conditions are good for a morning run before getting dressed

**Entry Points:** 
- App launch (primary)
- Push notification tap
- Widget tap (PWA)

**Success Criteria:** User can determine run viability within 10 seconds

#### Flow Diagram

- Viewport meta: `viewport-fit=cover` for edge-to-edge design
- Touch detection: Dynamically adjust UI density based on input type
- Orientation handling: Optimize for both portrait (walking) and landscape (cycling mount)

**Angular Implementation:**
- Use Angular CDK Layout module with `breakpointObserver.observe()`
- Implement responsive images: `<img [srcset]>` with WebP fallbacks
- Lazy load route modules based on device capabilities
- Use CSS Container Queries for component-level responsiveness
- Implement `@angular/cdk/a11y` LiveAnnouncer for screen size changes

**Performance by Viewport:**
- Mobile: Fetch only essential data, 24-hour max
- Tablet: Load 3-day forecast, defer extended data
- Desktop: Full 7-day data, prefetch adjacent locations
- Wide: Load all data, enable background sync

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

1. **Purpose-Driven Motion** - Every animation serves a functional purpose, not decoration
2. **Performance First** - All animations run at 60fps using GPU-accelerated properties
3. **Natural Easing** - Use Material Design easing curves (ease-in-out for entries, ease-out for exits)
4. **Respect Preferences** - Honor `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility
5. **Contextual Speed** - Quick actions (100-200ms), transitions (300ms), complex (400-600ms)

### Key Animations

- **Route Transitions:** Shared element transitions between views using Angular Router animations (Duration: 300ms, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1))
- **Weather Card Flip:** 3D card rotation revealing extended forecast on back (Duration: 600ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Activity Score Pulse:** Subtle scale animation when conditions change (Duration: 400ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Map Overlay Fade:** Smooth opacity transition when switching weather layers (Duration: 250ms, Easing: linear)
- **Loading Skeleton:** Shimmer effect on content placeholders using gradient animation (Duration: 1500ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Pull-to-Refresh:** Elastic overscroll with rotation animation on spinner (Duration: Variable, Easing: spring physics)
- **Precipitation Alert:** Attention-grabbing slide-in with slight bounce (Duration: 500ms, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55))
- **Temperature Change:** Number ticker animation when temperature updates (Duration: 800ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Wind Direction:** Smooth rotation of wind indicator arrow (Duration: 1000ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Chart Updates:** Staggered bar/line animations for data visualization (Duration: 50ms per item, Easing: ease-out)

**Angular Animation Implementation:**
```typescript
// Example: Weather card flip animation
trigger('cardFlip', [
  state('front', style({ transform: 'rotateY(0)' })),
  state('back', style({ transform: 'rotateY(180deg)' })),
  transition('front <=> back', animate('600ms ease-in-out'))
])
```

**Micro-interactions:**
- Touch ripples on all clickable elements (Material Design ripple)
- Hover elevation changes on cards (1dp → 3dp)
- Focus ring animations (fade-in 150ms)
- Icon morphing for weather condition changes
- Haptic feedback for critical actions (using Vibration API)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals
- **Page Load:** Initial meaningful paint < 1.5s, fully interactive < 3s on 3G
- **Interaction Response:** All user interactions respond within 100ms
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60fps for all animations, even on mid-range devices

### Design Strategies
- **Progressive Loading:** Show skeleton screens immediately, load data incrementally
- **Image Optimization:** Use WebP with JPEG fallbacks, implement lazy loading for off-screen images
- **Bundle Splitting:** Separate vendor, main, and feature modules for optimal caching
- **Service Worker:** Cache critical assets and API responses for offline functionality
- **Virtual Scrolling:** Use Angular CDK virtual scrolling for long lists
- **Debouncing:** Throttle map interactions and search inputs to prevent excessive API calls
- **Preconnect:** Add DNS prefetch for weather API and map tile servers
- **Critical CSS:** Inline above-the-fold styles, defer non-critical stylesheets
- **Web Fonts:** Use font-display: swap, subset fonts to required characters
- **Memory Management:** Implement OnPush change detection, unsubscribe from observables
