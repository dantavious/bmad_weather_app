## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
The previous story (3.3 - Smart Activity Recommendations) successfully implemented:
- Service architecture patterns with proper caching (10-minute TTL)
- Signal-based state management for reactive updates
- Material Design 3 component integration
- Comprehensive error handling patterns
These patterns should be followed for PWA service implementation.

### Existing PWA Infrastructure
- **Service Worker**: Basic service worker exists at `frontend/src/service-worker.js` with:
  - Basic caching for essential routes (/, /dashboard, /settings/alerts)
  - Push notification handling for precipitation alerts
  - Background sync for offline alert queuing
  - IndexedDB integration for offline storage
  - This file needs enhancement for complete offline support
  [Source: Existing codebase inspection]

- **Angular PWA Config**: `frontend/ngsw-config.json` exists with:
  - Basic asset group configuration
  - Weather API data group with 5-minute cache
  - Navigation URLs configuration
  - Needs updating for comprehensive offline support
  [Source: Existing codebase inspection]

### Technology Stack
- **Angular 20.0**: Framework includes "enhanced PWA capabilities"
  [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#line-10]
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless auth compatible with PWA
  [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#line-19]
- **Service Worker**: Custom implementation with Angular service worker support

### Offline Infrastructure (To Be Created)
- **Offline Service**: New service needed to manage offline state detection
- **Offline Indicator Component**: New component for UI feedback
- **Offline Fallback**: Static HTML page for service worker offline response
- **Note**: Architecture documents reference offline infrastructure that will be implemented as part of this story

### Implementation Order
1. **PWA Manifest & Icons** (foundation)
   - Create manifest.json
   - Generate icon set
   - Link in index.html

2. **Offline Service** (state management)
   - Create offline.service.ts with online/offline detection
   - Implement connection state signals

3. **Service Worker Enhancement** (caching)
   - Extend existing service-worker.js
   - Update ngsw-config.json

4. **UI Components** (user feedback)
   - Create offline-indicator component
   - Create install-banner component

5. **Background Sync** (data freshness)
   - Implement sync queue service
   - Add sync event handlers

6. **Testing & Validation** (quality assurance)
   - Unit tests for each component
   - Integration tests for offline scenarios
   - Lighthouse audit

### Angular PWA Setup Documentation
Key setup information from Angular official documentation:
- **Installation**: Use Angular CLI to add service worker support, which generates `ngsw-config.json`
- **HTTPS Requirement**: PWA must be served over HTTPS (localhost exempt for development)
- **Browser Support**: Check service worker availability with `SwUpdate.isEnabled`
- **Cache Strategy**: Angular caches entire app as single unit with consistent file versions
- **Background Updates**: Resources update in background, only downloading changed files
- **Manifest Generation**: Creates `ngsw.json` with content hashes for version tracking
[Source: https://angular.dev/ecosystem/service-workers]

### Angular 20 Implementation Patterns
Use modern Angular 20 patterns for PWA services:
```typescript
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class InstallPromptService {
  private deferredPrompt = signal<any>(null);
  private visitCount = signal<number>(0);
  
  canInstall = computed(() => 
    this.deferredPrompt() !== null && this.visitCount() >= 2
  );
  
  constructor(
    private swUpdate: SwUpdate  // Angular service worker update service
  ) {
    this.loadVisitCount();
    this.captureInstallPrompt();
    // Check if service workers are supported
    if (this.swUpdate.isEnabled) {
      this.initializeUpdateChecks();
    }
  }
  
  private captureInstallPrompt() {
    window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', (e) => {
      e.preventDefault();
      this.deferredPrompt.set(e);
    });
  }
}
```
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#angular-20-specific-patterns - pattern adapted for PWA]

### Service Worker Patterns
Enhanced service worker caching strategies:
```javascript
// Cache strategies for different resource types
const cacheStrategies = {
  static: 'cache-first',    // HTML, CSS, JS
  api: 'network-first',     // Weather data
  images: 'cache-first'     // Icons, assets
};

// Implement stale-while-revalidate for weather data
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  if (isWeatherAPI(event.request)) {
    event.respondWith(staleWhileRevalidate(event.request));
  }
});
```
[Source: PWA best practices - implementation pattern]

### PWA Manifest Structure
Standard PWA manifest configuration:
```json
{
  "name": "BMad Weather Dashboard",
  "short_name": "BMad Weather",
  "description": "Personal weather dashboard with precipitation alerts",
  "theme_color": "#6750A4",  // Material Design 3 primary
  "background_color": "#FEF7FF",  // Material Design 3 surface
  "display": "standalone",
  "scope": "/",
  "start_url": "/dashboard",
  "icons": [/* various sizes */]
}
```
[Source: PWA specification requirements]

### Security Considerations
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: PWA requires HTTPS in production (localhost exempt for dev)
  - Angular PWA will only activate service worker on secure origins
  - Implement HTTP to HTTPS redirect at deployment level
- **Service Worker Security**:
  - Validate all cached responses to prevent cache poisoning
  - Implement cache versioning to ensure clean updates
  - Use Angular's built-in SwUpdate service for secure updates
  - Never cache sensitive user data or authentication tokens
- **Content Security Policy**:
  - Configure CSP headers to allow service worker registration
  - Restrict worker-src to same origin
- **Cross-Origin Resources**:
  - Only cache same-origin resources by default
  - Validate CORS headers for any cross-origin API calls
  - Weather API responses must include proper CORS headers

### Testing Requirements
- **Test Framework**: Jest with Angular Testing utilities
- **Service Worker Testing Tools**:
  - `@angular/service-worker/testing` for Angular SW testing
  - `service-worker-mock` npm package for unit testing custom SW code
  - Chrome DevTools Application tab for manual SW testing
- **PWA Testing Approach**:
  ```typescript
  // Example service worker test setup
  import { SwTestHarness } from '@angular/service-worker/testing';
  
  describe('Service Worker', () => {
    let harness: SwTestHarness;
    
    beforeEach(async () => {
      harness = await SwTestHarness.create('/base/ngsw-config.json');
    });
    
    it('should cache static assets', async () => {
      const response = await harness.client.fetch('/assets/icons/icon-72x72.png');
      expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    });
  });
  ```
- **Browser Testing Matrix**:
  - Chrome/Edge (full PWA support)
  - Firefox (partial PWA support)
  - Safari iOS (limited PWA support)
- **Network Simulation**: Test with Chrome DevTools network throttling
- **Lighthouse Requirements**: PWA score must exceed 90

### Project Structure Notes
- Follows established patterns from previous stories
- Service worker enhancement builds on existing implementation
- Shared components directory established for offline indicator
- Core services follow existing patterns
- No structural conflicts identified

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Install Flow**: Verify prompt appears after second visit
2. **Offline Mode**: Test app functionality without network
3. **Cache Strategies**: Verify correct caching for different resources
4. **Background Sync**: Test data updates when reconnecting
5. **Offline Indicator**: Verify banner appears/disappears correctly
6. **Service Worker Lifecycle**: Test update and activation
7. **Data Persistence**: Verify weather data available offline
8. **Lighthouse Audit**: Must achieve PWA score > 90

### Test Data
- Mock weather data for offline testing
- Simulated network conditions (offline, slow 3G, fast 3G)
- Various browser scenarios (first visit, returning user, installed)
- Different device types (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Multiple cache states (empty, partial, full)

- ✅ IndexedDB with proper error boundaries
- ✅ Cache versioning strategy (v2)
- ✅ Secure update prompts with user consent
- ✅ No sensitive data caching
- ✅ Proper CORS handling for API calls

### Performance Considerations
**EXCELLENT OPTIMIZATION**
