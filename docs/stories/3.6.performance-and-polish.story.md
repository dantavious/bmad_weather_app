## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.5 (Solar Calculator):
- Successfully implemented Angular 20 components using signals and new control flow syntax
- Created comprehensive error handling with fallback mechanisms
- Implemented proper caching with 1-hour TTL
- All unit tests passing (150 backend tests, frontend tests passing)

### Performance Requirements
[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]
- **Bundle Size Target**: < 200KB initial (with lazy loading)
- **Response Time Target**: < 100ms for cached, < 500ms for fresh data
- **Error Rate Target**: < 0.1%
- **Cache Hit Rate Target**: > 70%
- **Frontend Loading Strategy**: Lazy load map and PWA features
- **Caching Strategy**: Service Worker with cache-first for assets
- **Backend Caching**: 10-minute TTL for weather, 1-hour for forecasts

### Monitoring Metrics
[Source: architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md]
**Frontend Metrics**:
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- JavaScript errors
- API response times
- Service Worker cache hit rate

**Backend Metrics**:
- Request rate
- Error rate (target < 0.1%)
- Response time (p95 < 500ms)
- Cache hit rate (target > 70%)
- External API calls per minute

### Error Handling Implementation
[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]
- **Error Response Format**: Standardized ApiError interface with code, message, details, timestamp, requestId
- **Frontend**: ErrorInterceptor for HTTP errors with user-friendly messages
- **Backend**: AllExceptionsFilter for consistent error responses
- **Status Codes**: Handle connection lost (0), rate limiting (429), server errors (500)

### Technology Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: Angular 20.0, TypeScript 5.6+, RxJS 7.8+, Angular Material 20.0
- **Backend**: NestJS 11.0+, TypeScript 5.6+
- **Testing**: Jest 30+, Testing Library 16+, Playwright 1.48+ for E2E
- **Logging**: Pino 9.5+ for structured logging
- **Build**: ESBuild + Vite via Angular CLI
- **Monitoring**: Console Logging for MVP, future Google Analytics

### MVP vs Production Implementation
- **Error Tracking**: Console logging (MVP) → Sentry integration (Production)
- **Analytics**: Console event logging (MVP) → Google Analytics 4 (Production)
- **Performance Monitoring**: Lighthouse CI (Both MVP and Production)

### Performance Budget Configuration
Add to angular.json under projects > frontend > architect > build > configurations > production:
```json
"budgets": [
  {
    "type": "initial",
    "maximumWarning": "200kb",
    "maximumError": "250kb"
  },
  {
    "type": "anyComponentStyle",
    "maximumWarning": "6kb",
    "maximumError": "10kb"
  }
]
```

### Project Structure
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Frontend performance files**: frontend/src/app/core/services/
- **Backend monitoring**: backend/src/common/filters/, backend/src/common/guards/
- **E2E tests**: e2e/specs/
- **Configuration**: Root package.json with npm workspaces

### Critical Angular 20 Rules
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **NEVER import CDK modules at application level** - causes NG0203 errors
- Use inject() function over constructor injection
- Use new control flow syntax (@if, @for, @switch)
- Follow Material Design 3 theming patterns
- Ensure proper signal cleanup with takeUntilDestroyed()

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Distribution**: E2E (10%), Integration (30%), Frontend Unit (30%), Backend Unit (30%)
- **Frontend Tests**: Use TestBed with standalone components
- **Backend Tests**: Use NestJS Testing Module
- **E2E Tests**: Use Playwright with data-testid attributes
- **Performance Tests**: Lighthouse CI for automated performance testing
- **Lighthouse CI Command**: `npx lighthouse http://localhost:4200 --output=json --output-path=./lighthouse-report.json --preset=desktop`

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Test file locations**: 
  - Frontend: Same directory as component/service with .spec.ts extension
  - Backend: Same directory as controller/service with .spec.ts extension
  - E2E: e2e/specs/ directory
- **Testing frameworks**:
  - Unit/Integration: Jest 30+ with Testing Library
  - E2E: Playwright 1.48+
  - Performance: Lighthouse CI
- **Test patterns**:
  - Use TestBed for Angular components
  - Mock external dependencies
  - Test error scenarios and edge cases
  - Include performance benchmarks in tests
- **Specific requirements for this story**:
  - Performance tests must validate all acceptance criteria
  - Memory leak tests must run for extended sessions
  - Error tracking tests must cover all error types
  - Analytics tests must verify event firing

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-31

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The performance and polish implementation shows good architectural decisions with proper error handling, analytics, and monitoring infrastructure. However, several critical performance targets are not being met, particularly around bundle size optimization. The implementation follows Angular 20 best practices with proper signal usage, standalone components, and new control flow syntax.

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive error tracking service with structured logging
- Well-designed analytics service with Core Web Vitals tracking
- Proper health check endpoints with external API monitoring
- Good animation performance utilities with reduced motion support
- Correct usage of takeUntilDestroyed() for memory leak prevention
- Material Design 3 compliance in implemented components

**Critical Issues:**
- Initial bundle size is 864KB vs 200KB target (332% over budget)
- Frontend test suite has 31 failures (329 failed, 55 passed)
- Several AC-related tasks incomplete (UI text audit, performance tests)

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `/home/derrick/code/bmad/frontend/src/app/app.config.ts`
  - **Change**: Removed PreloadAllModules preloading strategy
  - **Why**: PreloadAllModules defeats the purpose of lazy loading by immediately loading all chunks
  - **How**: Changed from `withPreloading(PreloadAllModules)` to plain `provideRouter(routes)` for true lazy loading

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ [All Angular 20 patterns followed correctly, proper inject() usage, CDK rules observed]
- Project Structure: ✓ [Files organized according to unified structure]
- Testing Strategy: ✗ [Major test failures in frontend (31 failed suites), backend tests passing (150 tests)]
- All ACs Met: ✗ [Critical performance targets missed, testing incomplete]

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Optimized preloading strategy to prevent unnecessary bundle bloat
- [ ] Bundle size reduction - needs aggressive optimization to meet 200KB target
- [ ] Fix frontend test suite failures (31 failed test suites)
- [ ] Complete UI text audit for Material Design 3 guidelines (AC 8)
- [ ] Write missing unit tests for error tracking, analytics, and performance utilities
- [ ] Add actual Lighthouse CI integration tests
- [ ] Implement critical CSS inlining for initial paint optimization
- [ ] Complete memory leak detection tests with extended session simulation
- [ ] Add performance monitoring alerts and cache hit rate monitoring

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Error tracking service properly sanitizes sensitive information, and health endpoints expose only necessary system information without credentials.

### Performance Considerations

**Critical Performance Issues Found:**
1. **Bundle Size Exceeds Target by 332%**: Initial bundle is 864KB vs 200KB target
   - Root cause: Material Design components included in initial bundle
   - Impact: Violates AC1 (Lighthouse >90), AC2 (FCP <1.5s), AC3 (TTI <3s)

2. **Test Suite Reliability**: 31 failed test suites indicate potential runtime issues

**Performance Optimizations Implemented:**
- Removed eager preloading to enable true lazy loading
- Configured performance budgets in angular.json
- Added animation performance utilities with reduced motion support

### Files Modified During Review

- `/home/derrick/code/bmad/frontend/src/app/app.config.ts` - Optimized preloading strategy

### Gate Status

Gate: FAIL → docs/qa/gates/3.6-performance-and-polish.yml
Risk profile: Critical performance targets not met, test reliability concerns
NFR assessment: Performance, reliability, and maintainability concerns identified

### Recommended Status

✗ Changes Required - Critical performance optimization and test fixes needed

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Bundle size optimization to meet 200KB target
2. Fix failing frontend test suite
3. Complete missing performance validation tests
4. Implement remaining UI polish tasks

**Note:** While infrastructure (error tracking, analytics, monitoring) is well-implemented, core performance acceptance criteria are not met. This story requires significant optimization work before it can be marked as complete.
