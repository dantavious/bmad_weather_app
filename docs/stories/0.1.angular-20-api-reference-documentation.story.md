# Story 0.1: Angular 20 API Reference Documentation - Brownfield Addition

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** developer working on the BMAD project,  
**I want** comprehensive Angular 20 API documentation accessible to coding agents,  
**So that** all code written uses the correct, latest Angular APIs and prevents runtime errors.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: All Angular frontend components and services
- Technology: Angular 20.2.0, TypeScript 5.6+, Angular Material 20.0
- Follows pattern: Project documentation and coding standards structure
- Touch points: Frontend application configuration, all Angular components and services

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Create `ANGULAR-20-REFERENCE.md` in project root containing:
   - Angular version declaration (20.2.0)
   - Key API patterns and best practices
   - Deprecated APIs to avoid
   - Links to https://next.angular.dev/api
   - Common migration issues and solutions

2. Update `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` with Angular 20 specific patterns:
   - Mandate use of `inject()` function over constructor injection
   - Document standalone components as default approach
   - Define signal-based state management patterns
   - Specify new control flow syntax (@if, @for, @switch)
   - Include Material Design 3 integration patterns

3. Create `.bmad-core/data/angular-20-apis.yaml` reference file with:
   - Common provider configuration patterns
   - Injection context requirements and examples
   - Material Design 3 component usage patterns
   - Testing patterns for Angular 20
   - Error handling patterns specific to v20

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing Angular application continues to work unchanged
5. New documentation follows existing project documentation patterns
6. Integration with core-config.yaml maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Documentation is comprehensive and includes working examples
8. All Angular 20 specific patterns are clearly explained
9. No regression in existing functionality verified

- [x] Configure automatic loading (AC: 6)
  - [x] Add ANGULAR-20-REFERENCE.md to devLoadAlwaysFiles in core-config.yaml
  - [x] Verify file is loaded on agent activation

- [x] Test and validate (AC: 7, 8, 9)
  - [x] Verify all examples in documentation are working
  - [x] Test that existing Angular application still functions
  - [x] Validate that coding agents can access the documentation

## Dev Notes

### Angular 20 Critical Changes
The project uses Angular 20.2.0, which has significant API changes from earlier versions:

1. **Dependency Injection Changes**:
   - `inject()` function is preferred over constructor injection
   - Injection must occur in proper context (constructor, field initializer, factory function)
   - `provideBrowserGlobalErrorListeners()` is deprecated and causes NG0203 errors

2. **Component Architecture**:
   - Standalone components are now the default
   - No NgModule declarations needed for standalone components
   - Use `importProvidersFrom()` for module providers in standalone apps

3. **State Management**:
   - Signals are the preferred reactive primitive
   - Use `signal()`, `computed()`, and `effect()` for reactive state
   - RxJS still used for complex async operations

4. **Control Flow**:
   - New syntax: `@if`, `@for`, `@switch` instead of `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`
   - Better type checking and performance

### Relevant Source Tree
- `/frontend/src/app/app.config.ts` - Main application configuration
- `/frontend/src/app/` - All Angular components and services
- `/docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` - Current coding standards
- `/docs/architecture/tech-stack.md` - Technology stack documentation
- `/.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` - Core configuration for agent loading

### Testing Standards
- Use Jest for unit testing (v30+)
- Use Angular Testing Library (v16+)
- Test files should be colocated with source files
- Follow Angular 20 testing patterns with TestBed.configureTestingModule()

## Definition of Done

- [x] ANGULAR-20-REFERENCE.md created and comprehensive
- [x] Coding standards updated with Angular 20 patterns
- [x] Angular 20 API YAML reference created
- [x] Documentation added to devLoadAlwaysFiles
- [x] All examples tested and working
- [x] Existing application verified to work unchanged
- [x] Documentation accessible to coding agents

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Incomplete documentation leading to continued API misuse
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive examples and clear migration notes
- **Rollback:** Documentation only - no code changes, can be updated iteratively

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [x] Database changes (if any) are additive only - N/A
- [x] UI changes follow existing design patterns - N/A (documentation only)
- [x] Performance impact is negligible - Documentation only
