### Data Models

**WeatherForecast Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
```typescript
export interface WeatherForecast extends WeatherData {
  tempMin: number;
  tempMax: number;
  precipitationChance: number;
}
```

**Base WeatherData Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
```typescript
interface WeatherData {
  temperature: number;
  feelsLike: number;
  conditions: string;
  icon: string;
  humidity: number;
  windSpeed: number;
  windDirection: number;
  precipitation: number;
  cloudCover: number;
  pressure: number;
  uvIndex: number;
  visibility: number;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

### API Specifications

**Forecast Endpoint** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
- `GET /weather/forecast/{locationId}` - Returns 7-day forecast array
- Response: `WeatherForecast[]` with daily forecast data
- Caching: 1 hour TTL using `CacheKeys.forecast(locationId)` pattern

**Batch Forecast Option** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
- `POST /weather/batch` - Fetch forecasts for multiple locations
- Useful for dashboard optimization

### Component Specifications

**WeatherCardComponent Updates** [Source: architecture/components.md#dashboard]
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-weather-card',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule, MatCardModule],
  animations: [flipAnimation], // Add flip animation
  template: `
    <mat-card [class.flipped]="isFlipped()" (click)="flip()">
      <!-- Front: Current weather -->
      <mat-card-content class="card-front">
        {{ weather()?.temperature }}°
      </mat-card-content>
      <!-- Back: 7-day forecast -->
      <mat-card-content class="card-back">
        @for (day of forecast(); track day.timestamp) {
          <div class="forecast-day">
            {{ day.tempMin }}°/{{ day.tempMax }}°
          </div>
        }
      </mat-card-content>
    </mat-card>
  `
})
export class WeatherCardComponent {
  isFlipped = signal(false);
  forecast = signal<WeatherForecast[]>([]);
}
```

**Dashboard Component Interface** [Source: architecture/components.md]
- Method: `handleCardFlip(locationId: string): void`
- Responsibility: Manages flip states and forecast fetching

### File Locations
- Weather card component: `frontend/src/app/features/dashboard/components/weather-card/weather-card.component.ts`
- Forecast service updates: `frontend/src/app/core/services/weather.service.ts`
- Backend forecast endpoint: `backend/src/weather/controllers/weather.controller.ts`
- Shared forecast model: `shared/models/weather.model.ts`
- Animation definitions: `frontend/src/app/shared/animations/flip.animation.ts`

### State Management

**AppState Structure** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management]
```typescript
export interface AppState {
  forecasts: Signal<Map<string, WeatherForecast[]>>;
  weatherData: Signal<Map<string, WeatherData>>;
  isLoading: Signal<boolean>;
  flipStates: Signal<Map<string, boolean>>; // Track flip states per location
}
```

**Service Pattern** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management]
```typescript
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class StateService {
  readonly forecasts = signal<Map<string, WeatherForecast[]>>(new Map());
  readonly flipStates = signal<Map<string, boolean>>(new Map());
}
```

### Technical Constraints

**Animation Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use Angular Animations API for flip transitions
- Ensure 60fps performance with CSS transforms
- Use `transform: rotateY()` for 3D flip effect
- Implement `will-change: transform` for performance

**Caching Strategy** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#cache-key-strategies]
- Cache key: `weather:forecast:${locationId}`
- TTL: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- Storage: Backend memory cache + frontend IndexedDB
- File cache: `.cache/weather/forecast/{locationId}_{timestamp}.json`

**Mobile Gesture Support** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Use HammerJS or native touch events for swipe detection
- Threshold: minimum 50px horizontal swipe
- Prevent accidental triggers with velocity check

### Testing Requirements

**Component Testing** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
```typescript
describe('WeatherCardComponent', () => {
  it('should flip card when clicked', () => {
    component.flip();
    expect(component.isFlipped()).toBe(true);
  });
  
  it('should display forecast data on back', () => {
    component.forecast.set(mockForecastData);
    fixture.detectChanges();
    const forecastDays = fixture.nativeElement.querySelectorAll('.forecast-day');
    expect(forecastDays.length).toBe(7);
  });
  
  it('should handle swipe gestures on mobile', () => {
    // Test swipe gesture handling
  });
});
```

**E2E Testing** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
```typescript
test('should flip weather cards to show forecast', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.click('[data-testid="weather-card-0"]');
  await expect(page.locator('.card-back')).toBeVisible();
});
```

**Performance Testing**
- Measure flip animation FPS using Chrome DevTools
- Test with 5 cards animating simultaneously
- Ensure no frame drops on mobile devices

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates strong architectural understanding with properly structured backend and frontend components. The forecast endpoint, caching layer, and UI components are well-designed. However, the story is **not ready for production** due to failing tests, incomplete features, and performance issues that violate acceptance criteria.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✗ Animation timing violates 60fps requirement (600ms instead of 300ms)
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows established patterns correctly
- Testing Strategy: ✗ 30% of frontend tests failing, missing backend endpoint tests
- All ACs Met: ✗ AC#4 (60fps animation) and AC#5 (session persistence) not met

### Critical Issues Found

**Test Suite Failures (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- Frontend: 7 test suites failing with 30 total test failures
- Backend: Missing test coverage for forecast endpoint in controller specs
- Test data structure mismatches causing assertion failures

**Performance Issues**
- Animation duration set to 600ms instead of required 300ms for 60fps
- Missing CSS performance optimizations (`will-change: transform`)
- No performance testing for 5+ simultaneous card animations

**Missing Functionality**
- Flip states not persisted in session storage (AC#5 violation)
- No state restoration on component re-initialization
- Missing loading skeletons for forecast data
- No proper error retry mechanism

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical - Must Fix Before Review:**
- [ ] Fix all 30 failing frontend tests (weather.service.spec.ts, dashboard.component.spec.ts, etc.)
- [ ] Add missing backend controller tests for forecast endpoint
- [ ] Implement session storage persistence for flip states
- [ ] Change animation timing from 600ms to 300ms
- [ ] Add performance testing for multiple simultaneous animations

**Quality Improvements:**
- [ ] Add loading skeletons for forecast data fetching
- [ ] Implement proper error states with retry mechanisms
- [ ] Add accessibility attributes for screen readers
- [ ] Optimize CSS with hardware acceleration hints
- [ ] Add integration tests for complete forecast flow
- [ ] Consider batch API implementation for multiple forecasts

### Security Review

No security vulnerabilities identified. Input validation and error handling properly implemented. API keys protected, cache keys sanitized.

### Performance Considerations

- Animation performance not meeting 60fps requirement
- Batch forecast API option not implemented (could reduce API calls)
- Missing CSS optimization flags for hardware acceleration
- No performance testing framework in place

### Files Modified During Review

None - Review only, no refactoring performed due to broken test state.

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/1.6-seven-day-forecast-display.yml

Critical test failures and missing acceptance criteria prevent approval. The story falsely claims "Ready for Review" status when implementation is incomplete.

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required** - Return to Development

The story requires 2-3 days of additional work to:
1. Fix all failing tests
2. Complete missing functionality (session persistence)
3. Meet performance requirements (60fps animation)
4. Add proper error handling and loading states

Story should not have been marked "Ready for Review" with 30% test failure rate.
