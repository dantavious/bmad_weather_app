### Angular 20 Implementation Patterns
Use modern Angular 20 patterns:
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-activity-chips',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule, MatChipsModule],
  template: `
    @if (recommendations()) {
      <mat-chip-set class="activity-chips">
        @for (activity of filteredRecommendations(); track activity.activityType) {
          <mat-chip 
            [class.good-rating]="activity.rating === 'good'"
            [class.fair-rating]="activity.rating === 'fair'"
            [class.poor-rating]="activity.rating === 'poor'"
            (click)="expandDetails(activity)">
            {{ activity.activityType }} Â· {{ activity.rating }}
          </mat-chip>
        }
      </mat-chip-set>
    }
  `
})
export class ActivityChipsComponent {
  private activityService = inject(ActivityService);
  private settings = inject(SettingsService);
  
  recommendations = signal<ActivityRecommendation[]>([]);
  
  filteredRecommendations = computed(() => {
    const enabled = this.settings.activitySettings().enabledActivities;
    return this.recommendations().filter(r => enabled.includes(r.activityType));
  });
}
```
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#angular-20-specific-patterns]

### NestJS Backend Patterns
Follow NestJS 11 patterns for activity service:
```typescript
@Injectable()
export class ActivityCalculatorService {
  private readonly logger = new Logger(ActivityCalculatorService.name);
  
  calculateActivityRating(
    activity: ActivityType,
    weather: Weather
  ): ActivityRecommendation {
    const factors = this.evaluateWeatherFactors(activity, weather);
    const score = this.computeOverallScore(factors);
    const rating = this.scoreToRating(score);
    
    return {
      activityType: activity,
      rating,
      score,
      bestHours: this.findBestHours(activity, weather.hourly),
      factors
    };
  }
  
  private evaluateWeatherFactors(
    activity: ActivityType,
    weather: Weather
  ): Record<string, Rating> {
    // Activity-specific thresholds
    const thresholds = this.getActivityThresholds(activity);
    // Implementation details...
  }
}
```

### Files Modified During Review

No files modified - review was assessment only.

### Gate Status

**GATE DECISION: CONCERNS** 
- Gate file: `docs/qa/gates/3.3-smart-activity-recommendations.yml`
- **Reason:** Two critical ACs (6 & 7) unimplemented - users cannot view details or configure preferences
- **Impact:** Feature only 70% complete from user perspective

### Recommended Status

â ï¸ **CONCERNS - Changes Required**

**Blocking Issues:**
1. **AC 6 Failed:** No expandable details component - users cannot understand rating factors
2. **AC 7 Failed:** No settings UI - users cannot enable/disable activities
3. **Partial Integration:** Click handlers emit events but no component handles expansion

**Required for Done Status:**
1. Implement activity-details component with MatExpansionModule
2. Create settings feature module with activity toggles
3. Wire up click handlers to display expandable details
4. Add integration tests for new components
5. Resubmit for final QA review

While the technical foundation is excellent and the algorithm sophisticated, the missing user interaction components significantly impact usability and prevent story completion.
