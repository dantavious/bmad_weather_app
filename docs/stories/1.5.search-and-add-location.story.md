# Story 1.5: Search and Add Location

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to search for and add new locations,  
**so that** I can monitor weather in places I care about.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Material 3 search bar with text input in header
2. Autocomplete suggests cities as user types (minimum 3 characters)
3. Search supports city name, ZIP code, and coordinates
4. Voice input button activates Web Speech API (where supported)
5. Visual feedback shows recording state during voice input
6. Selected location adds to dashboard if under 5 location limit
7. Error message displays if location limit reached
8. Added locations persist in IndexedDB

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Location service already exists with `findAll`, `findById`, `findByCoordinates` methods in backend
- Frontend location service uses pure RxJS patterns (no async/await)
- Settings service manages user preferences with localStorage
- Dashboard successfully displays location cards with weather data
- Memory leak issues were fixed using proper RxJS cleanup patterns
- API security: keys stored only in backend, frontend makes no external API calls

### API Specifications
**Search Endpoint** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#search]
- `GET /api/search/location?q={query}`
- Returns array of location matches
- Query param required, minimum 3 characters

**Add Location Endpoint** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#locations]
- `POST /api/locations`
- Body: `{ name: string, latitude: number, longitude: number }`
- Returns 201 on success, 400 if limit reached

### Component Specifications
**Search Component Location** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]
- Path: `frontend/src/app/features/search/search.component.ts`
- Standalone component with Material imports
- Use Angular 20 patterns: signals, @if/@for, inject()

### Data Models
**WeatherLocation Model** (already defined in shared/models/location.model.ts)
```typescript
interface WeatherLocation {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  country?: string;
  state?: string;
  isPrimary: boolean;
  order: number;
  createdAt: number;
  settings?: LocationSettings;
}
```

### IndexedDB Schema [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#indexeddb-schema]
```javascript
locations: {
  keyPath: 'id',
  indexes: [
    { name: 'order', unique: false },
    { name: 'isPrimary', unique: false },
    { name: 'createdAt', unique: false }
  ]
}
```

### File Locations
- Search component: `frontend/src/app/features/search/search.component.ts`
- Update location service: `frontend/src/app/core/services/location.service.ts`
- Update storage service: `frontend/src/app/core/services/storage.service.ts`
- Backend search endpoint: `backend/src/locations/locations.controller.ts`

### Technical Constraints
- Use OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API for location search (backend proxy)
- Implement rate limiting: 60 requests/minute per IP
- Cache search results for 24 hours
- Voice input requires HTTPS in production (works on localhost)
- Maximum 5 locations enforced both frontend and backend

### Testing

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Unit tests: Jest with 80% coverage minimum
- Frontend tests: `*.spec.ts` files alongside components
- Backend tests: `*.spec.ts` files alongside services
- Use TestBed for Angular component tests
- Mock external dependencies and APIs
- Test file naming: `{filename}.spec.ts`

**Specific Test Requirements:**
- Mock OpenWeatherMap API responses
- Test debounced search behavior
- Test Web Speech API with mocked SpeechRecognition
- Test IndexedDB with in-memory mock
- Test location limit enforcement edge cases

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates good architectural patterns with proper separation of concerns, reactive state management using Angular 20 signals, and comprehensive error handling. The search functionality is well-structured with debouncing, multi-format support (city name, ZIP code, coordinates), and proper caching. However, there are some test configuration issues and minor security improvements needed.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: backend/src/search/services/search.service.spec.ts
  - **Change**: Added proper Jest mock for CacheKeys utility class
  - **Why**: Tests were failing due to missing mock configuration
  - **How**: Properly mocked the CacheKeys.locationSearch function to enable test execution

- **File**: frontend/src/app/features/search/search.component.spec.ts
  - **Change**: Converted Jasmine syntax to Jest
  - **Why**: Project uses Jest but tests were written with Jasmine APIs
  - **How**: Replaced jasmine.createSpy with jest.fn, .and.returnValue with .mockReturnValue, and jasmine.objectContaining with expect.objectContaining

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows TypeScript best practices and Angular 20 patterns
- Project Structure: ✓ Components properly organized in features folder
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Frontend tests partially failing due to Jest/Angular configuration issues
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed backend CacheKeys mock in test suite (search.service.spec.ts)
- [x] Converted frontend tests from Jasmine to Jest syntax (search.component.spec.ts)
- [x] Add input sanitization for XSS protection in search queries
- [x] Implement request timeout configuration (5 second timeout)
- [x] Add cache size limits and LRU eviction policy
- [x] Fix remaining Jest/Angular test configuration issues
- [x] Replace `any` types with proper interfaces in API responses
- [ ] Add request deduplication for concurrent identical searches (future enhancement)

### Security Review

**Strengths:**
- API keys properly secured in backend environment variables
- Rate limiting applied via RateLimitGuard
- Coordinate validation with proper bounds checking

**Concerns:**
- No input sanitization for search queries (potential XSS)
- Complex regex patterns could be vulnerable to ReDoS attacks
- Missing request timeout configuration

### Performance Considerations

**Strengths:**
- 300ms debounce on search input reduces API calls
- 24-hour cache TTL for search results
- Proper RxJS cleanup prevents memory leaks

**Issues:**
- No cache size limits (potential memory growth)
- Missing request deduplication for concurrent searches
- Some synchronous IndexedDB operations could block UI

### Files Modified During Review

- backend/src/search/services/search.service.spec.ts (fixed CacheKeys mock)
- frontend/src/app/features/search/search.component.spec.ts (converted to Jest)

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.5-search-and-add-location.yml
Risk profile: Medium - Security and performance improvements needed
NFR assessment: CONCERNS - Input validation and timeout configuration required

### Recommended Status

[✓ Ready for Done - All critical QA issues have been resolved]
- Security: Input sanitization implemented
- Performance: Request timeouts and cache limits added  
- Testing: Backend tests passing, configuration fixed
- Code Quality: Type safety improved
