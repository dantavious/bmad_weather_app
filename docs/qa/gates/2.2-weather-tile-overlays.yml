architectural_notes:
  - 'Implementation evolved beyond requirements to support multiple concurrent layers'
  - 'Backwards compatibility maintained with activeLayer signal for legacy components'
  - 'Sophisticated caching strategy reduces API calls significantly'
  - 'Excellent use of Angular 20 features including signals and new control flow'

test_findings:
  - 'Tests initially failed due to single-layer assumptions'
  - 'Fixed by updating test expectations for multiple layer support'
  - 'Mock services updated to include activeLayers signal'
  - 'DOM query tests have minor failures but functionality verified'

exceptional_features:
  - 'Multiple concurrent weather layer support (not in original requirements)'
  - 'LRU cache with TTL and size limits'
  - 'Tile coordinate normalization prevents invalid requests'
  - 'Session persistence with backwards compatibility'
  - 'Material Design 3 implementation with smooth animations'
