# Quality Gate Decision for Story 1.6
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

# Required fields
schema: 1
story: "1.6"
story_title: "Seven-Day Forecast Display"
gate: "FAIL"
status_reason: "Critical test failures (30% failure rate) and missing acceptance criteria (session persistence, 60fps animation) prevent approval"
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
