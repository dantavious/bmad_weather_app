    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'No cache limits, missing request timeouts, but good debouncing and caching strategy.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Proper error handling, graceful fallbacks, and memory leak prevention implemented.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Good code structure, proper separation of concerns, follows Angular 20 patterns.'
