Story: Location Dashboard with Current Weather

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 1
- Medium Risks: 2
- Low Risks: 4
- Risk Score: 54/100 (Moderate Risk)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: External API Key Exposure

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - API keys are often accidentally exposed in frontend code or commits
**Impact**: High - Exposed keys lead to API abuse, unexpected billing, and service disruption
**Mitigation**:
- Verify API keys are ONLY stored in backend environment variables
- Implement proxy pattern where frontend calls backend, backend calls external API
- Add API key rotation mechanism
- Implement rate limiting per client

**Testing Focus**: 
- Security scan for exposed secrets in frontend bundle
- Verify network requests don't contain API keys
- Test rate limiting effectiveness

## High Risk Items

### 2. PERF-001: Unoptimized API Calls

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Dashboard with 5 cards could trigger 5+ simultaneous API calls
**Impact**: Medium - Rate limit violations, slow page loads, poor user experience
**Mitigation**:
- Implement request batching for multiple locations
- Use backend caching with appropriate TTL
- Consider GraphQL or custom endpoint to fetch all data in one request
- Implement loading states to improve perceived performance

**Testing Focus**:
- Load testing with multiple concurrent users
- Verify caching behavior
- Test rate limit handling

## Risk Distribution

### By Category
- Security: 2 risks (1 critical)
- Performance: 2 risks (1 high)
- Data: 1 risk (0 critical)
- Technical: 2 risks (0 critical)
- Operational: 1 risk (0 critical)

### By Component
- Frontend: 4 risks
- Backend: 3 risks
- External Dependencies: 1 risk

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|-------------|---------|--------|----------|
| SEC-001 | API Key Exposure | Security | High (3) | High (3) | 9 | Critical |
| PERF-001 | Unoptimized API Calls | Performance | High (3) | Medium (2) | 6 | High |
| TECH-001 | RxJS Memory Leaks | Technical | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| OPS-001 | Error State Recovery | Operational | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| SEC-002 | Missing CORS Configuration | Security | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| DATA-001 | localStorage Data Loss | Data | Medium (2) | Low (1) | 2 | Low |
| PERF-002 | Large DOM with Many Cards | Performance | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Low |
| TECH-002 | Browser Compatibility | Technical | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Low |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Security Testing**:
  - Scan frontend bundle for exposed secrets
  - Verify all API calls go through backend proxy
  - Test API rate limiting and throttling
  - Check for XSS vulnerabilities in weather data display

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests  
- **Performance Testing**:
  - Load test with 100+ concurrent users
  - Test dashboard with maximum 5 locations
  - Verify caching reduces API calls
  - Test behavior when API rate limit is hit

### Priority 3: Medium Risk Tests
- **Memory Leak Testing**:
  - Long-running session tests (4+ hours)
  - Monitor browser memory usage
  - Verify proper cleanup on route navigation

- **Error Recovery Testing**:
  - Network failure simulation
  - API timeout scenarios
  - Retry mechanism validation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- SEC-001: API keys must not be exposed in frontend
- PERF-001: Must implement caching to prevent API abuse

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- TECH-001: Acceptable with proper subscription management
- OPS-001: Acceptable with retry mechanism and user feedback

### Accepted Risks
- DATA-001: localStorage limitations accepted for MVP
- PERF-002: DOM performance acceptable for 5 cards max

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **API Metrics**: Call volume, rate limit hits, response times
- **Error Rates**: Failed API calls, timeout rates
- **Performance**: Dashboard load times, time to interactive
- **Security**: Anomalous API usage patterns

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Adding more than 5 locations per dashboard
- Changing API provider or authentication method
- Implementing real-time weather updates
- Adding user authentication system
- Expanding to production scale

## Recommendations

### Testing Priority
1. Security scan for exposed secrets
2. API rate limit testing
3. Performance testing with concurrent users
4. Memory leak detection
5. Error recovery scenarios

### Development Focus
- Implement backend API proxy immediately
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Ensure proper RxJS subscription cleanup
- Add request caching layer

### Deployment Strategy
- Use feature flags for weather dashboard
- Monitor API usage closely post-deployment
- Have rollback plan ready
- Start with limited user rollout
